# Single Threat Scripts

This repository contains scripts for Single Threat, a first-person survival game currently in development. These scripts handle various gameplay systems and mechanics.

*Please note: many of these scripts may be buggy or incomplete. Due to the scope of the project, I’ve had to cut a few corners during development — expect ongoing changes and improvements.*
